# PAPER-MUSKETEERS
This is an in progress github for anyone who was interested in wokring towards publishing an acadmeic paper under Dr.Noah Davis and ARL.

We are creating a research program for our club. 
This program is supervised by Dr. Noah Davis. We are self-driven students
who are wanting to do collective research over the year with the intent of publishing a paper. 
This is a great opportunity to be a part of building the foundation of UT Austin’s Quantum Community
and build our reputation for undergraduate research initiatives :).
